# To Do Maker

The To Do Maker was built utilizing HTML, CSS and jQuery. This application was a good exercise to practice manipulating the DOM using jQuery.

## About The Game

At the top of this application, you can click on the "Add New Todo" spot to add a new todo to your list. If you hover over any of the todos, then a trash can will appear that you can click on to delete that particular todo. If you click on the icon in the upper right hand corner, than it will toggle the "Add New Todo" section from being shown to hidden.
